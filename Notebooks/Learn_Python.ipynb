That time it's enough to instruct computer through a conditional logic or pattern like flowchart diagram. In this language, we break the problem statement into smaller chunks and made binary decisions. `Example: C language`\n",

Also create relationships between the objects (oops concept). `Example: C++ , Java`\n",
        "\n",
